/**
 * Descriptions used by protobuf.
 *
 * If something fails regarding operations serialization, most probably you forgot to update and recompile protobuf descriptions.
 *
 * Change the below descriptions accordingly to changes done to the data that is compressed.
 * Then, rebuild compiled messages. To do that run `node dev/scripts/compilemessages.js` from main directory.
 *
 * If you added a new operation type, add it also in `compressor.ts`.
 *
 * Make sure that the new `compiledmessages.js` is pushed to GH repository.
